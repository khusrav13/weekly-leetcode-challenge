# LeetCode 150 Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my personal coding challenge! This repository documents my journey through the curated [LeetCode 150 Problems list](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) (formerly known as LeetCode 75, now expanded). My goal is to challenge my data structures and algorithms skills by solving **5 - 10 problems each week** and tracking my progress here.


## ✨ Project Goal

* Complete 5-10 problems from the LeetCode 150 list every week.
* Implement solutions in Python.


## 🙏 Acknowledgements

* The brilliant team at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for creating this valuable study resource.
